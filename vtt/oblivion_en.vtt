00:00:58.272 --> 00:01:02.938
I flew beyond the sun
before it was time

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:09.046
Burning all the gold
that held me inside my shell

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:13.613
Waiting for you to pull me back in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.747
I almost had the world in my sight

00:01:17.772 --> 00:01:23.162
Lost love,
bright eyes fading

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:28.480
Faster than stars falling

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:37.886
How can
I tell you that I've failed?

00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:39.622
Tell you I failed

00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:45.636
Falling from grace
'cause I've been away too long

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:52.647
Leaving you behind
with my lonesome song

00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:59.907
Now I'm lost in oblivion

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:04.563
I tried to burrow a hole
into the ground

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.781
Breaking all the fingers
and the nails from my hand

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.438
The eyes of a child
see no wrong

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:19.647
Ignorant bliss,
impending doom

00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:24.983
Lost love,
bright eyes fading

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.430
Faster than stars falling

00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:39.440
How can
I tell you that I've failed?

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:41.352
Tell you I failed

00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:47.289
Falling from grace
'cause I've been away too long

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:54.647
Leaving you behind
with my lonesome song

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.162
Now I'm lost

00:02:59.521 --> 00:03:05.912
Falling from grace
'cause I've been away too long

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.438
Leaving you behind
with my lonesome song

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:20.438
Now I'm lost in oblivion

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:47.148
Falling from grace
'cause I've been away too long

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:54.835
Leaving you behind
with my lonesome song

00:04:55.602 --> 00:04:59.086
Now I'm lost

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:06.083
Falling from grace
'cause I've been away too long

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:13.377
Leaving you behind
with my lonesome song

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:20.660
Now I'm lost in oblivion

00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:27.884
In oblivion

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:38.708
In oblivion
