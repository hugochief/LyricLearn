And into the darkness

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.647 line:95.75%
Did you feel I was divine?

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:25.706 line:95.75%
'Cause I felt the power
when I laid down at your side

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.418 line:95.75%
I felt the rhythm,
I felt the fever in your mind

00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:38.146 line:95.75%
I couldn't save you,
but at least I say I tried

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:42.540 line:95.75%
If your love was ever mine

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.743 line:95.75%
It would stay with me tonight

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.238 line:95.75%
I'm praying, praying

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.787 line:95.75%
You can see it in my eyes

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.236 line:95.75%
There's a rage that still reminds me

00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:03.405 line:95.75%
I'm waiting, waiting

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:06.660 line:95.75%
You don't believe in one divine

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:09.762 line:95.75%
But can you tell me
you believe in mine?

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.570 line:95.75%
'Cause you've been my god, 
my god

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.680 line:95.75%
And when you're gone,
I'm godless, I'm godless

00:01:16.774 --> 00:01:18.958 line:95.75%
You don't believe in love

00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:22.291 line:95.75%
But can you say that
you've been thinking of us?

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:24.987 line:95.75%
'Cause you've been my god, 
my god

00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:28.781 line:95.75%
And when you're gone,
I'm godless, I'm godless

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:34.360 line:95.75%
I swallow my fable
that I was not enough

00:01:34.847 --> 00:01:39.467 line:95.75%
But with my eyes closed,
I'm still dancing in your love

00:01:41.014 --> 00:01:47.178 line:95.75%
Inside I'm dreaming,
I'll be alone with you again

00:01:47.253 --> 00:01:52.197 line:95.75%
And I can still hold you
like I held you in the end

00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:55.879 line:95.75%
You don't believe in one divine

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:59.206 line:95.75%

my god

I'm godless, I'm godless

00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:08.303 line:95.75%
You don't believe in love

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:11.516 line:95.75%
But can you say
that you've been thinking of us?

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.116 line:95.75%
'Cause you've been my god, 
my god

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:18.129 line:95.75%

I'm godless, I'm godless

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:21.017 line:95.75%

my god
