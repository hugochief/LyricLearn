00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:33.248 line:95.75%
I etched the face 
of a stopwatch

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:36.374 line:95.75%
On the back of a raindrop

00:00:36.598 --> 00:00:41.907 line:95.75%
And did a swap for the sand
in an hourglass

00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:46.384 line:95.75%
I heard an unhappy ending

00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:50.053 line:95.75%
It sort of sounds like you leaving

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.493 line:95.75%
I heard the piledriver waltz

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:56.976 line:95.75%
It woke me up this morning

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:06.747 line:95.75%
You look like
you've been for breakfast

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.902 line:95.75%
At the heartbreak hotel

00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:12.716 line:95.75%
And sat in the back booth 
by the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.681 line:95.75%
Pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.905 line:95.75%
Your waitress was miserable
and so was your food

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:27.776 line:95.75%
If you're gonna try 
and walk on water

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:32.383 line:95.75%
Make sure you wear
your comfortable shoes

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:39.118 line:95.75%
Mysteries flashing amber
go green when you answer

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:43.442 line:95.75%
But the red on the rest
of the questionnaire

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:46.682 line:95.75%
Never changes

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.968 line:95.75%
I heard the news
that you're planning

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:53.409 line:95.75%
To shoot me out of a cannon

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:56.985 line:95.75%
I heard the piledriver waltz

00:01:57.068 --> 00:02:01.923 line:95.75%
It woke me up this morning

00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:10.384 line:95.75%
You look like you've
been for breakfast

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:13.317 line:95.75%
At the heartbreak hotel

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:16.503 line:95.75%
And sat in the back booth 
by the

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:22.256 line:95.75%
Pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:28.270 line:95.75%
Your waitress was miserable
and so was your food

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.200 line:95.75%
If you're gonna try 
and walk on water

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:36.256 line:95.75%
Make sure you wear
your comfortable shoes

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:43.526 line:95.75%
