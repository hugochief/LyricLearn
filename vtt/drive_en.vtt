Sometimes I feel the fear of

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:29.666 line:95.75%
Uncertainty stinging clear

00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:36.058 line:95.75%
And I, I can't help but ask myself

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:40.914 line:95.75%
How much I let the fear
take the wheel and steer

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.041 line:95.75%
It's driven me before

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:49.943 line:95.75%
And it seems to have a vague

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:53.891 line:95.75%
Haunting mass appeal

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.871 line:95.75%
But lately I'm beginning to find

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:03.895 line:95.75%
That I should be the one
behind the wheel

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:10.554 line:95.75%
Whatever tomorrow brings,
I’ll be there

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:13.800 line:95.75%
With open arms and open eyes

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:21.131 line:95.75%
Whatever tomorrow brings,
I’ll be there

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:24.786 line:95.75%
I’ll be there

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.709 line:95.75%
So if I decide to waiver my chance

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:33.187 line:95.75%
To be one of the hive

00:01:36.354 --> 00:01:39.985 line:95.75%
Will I choose
water over wine

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.527 line:95.75%
And hold my own and drive?

00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:50.849 line:95.75%
It's driven me before
and it seems to be

00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:57.273 line:95.75%
The way that everyone else
gets around

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:01.526 line:95.75%
But lately I'm beginning to find

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.482 line:95.75%
That when I drive myself
my light is found

00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:13.983 line:95.75%
Whatever tomorrow brings,
I’ll be there

00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:17.458 line:95.75%
With open arms and open eyes

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.680 line:95.75%
Whatever tomorrow brings,
I’ll be there

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:28.163 line:95.75%
I’ll be there

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:57.165 line:95.75%
Would you choose
water over wine?

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.931 line:95.75%
Hold the wheel and drive

00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:09.674 line:95.75%
Whatever tomorrow brings,
I’ll be there

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:13.038 line:95.75%
With open arms and open eyes

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:20.217 line:95.75%
Whatever tomorrow brings,
I’ll be there

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.962 line:95.75%
I’ll be there
