00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.074 line:95.75%
Angels on the sideline

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:43.784 line:95.75%
Puzzled and amused

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:49.402 line:95.75%
Why did Father
give these humans free will?

00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:54.935 line:95.75%
Now they're all confused

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:04.688 line:95.75%
Don't these talking monkeys know
that Eden has enough to go around?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.441 line:95.75%
Plenty in this holy garden,
silly monkeys

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:17.295 line:95.75%
Where there's one
you're bound to divide it

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:30.961 line:95.75%
Right in two

00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:46.374 line:95.75%
Angels on the sideline

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:51.668 line:95.75%
Baffled and confused

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:57.692 line:95.75%
Father blessed them all with reason

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:02.855 line:95.75%
And this is what they choose

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.526 line:95.75%
(This is what they choose)

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.550 line:95.75%
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey
over pieces of the ground

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:21.327 line:95.75%
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs,
they forge a blade

00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:25.485 line:95.75%
And where there's one
they're bound to divide it

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:34.696 line:95.75%
Right in two

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:49.505 line:95.75%
Right in two

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:58.093 line:95.75%
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey
over pieces of the ground

00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:06.266 line:95.75%
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs,
they make a club

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.271 line:95.75%
And beat their brother down

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:19.735 line:95.75%
How they've survived
so misguided is a mystery

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:29.499 line:95.75%
Repugnant is a creature
who would squander the ability

00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:36.552 line:95.75%
To lift an eye to heaven,
conscious of his fleeting time here

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:43.399 line:95.75%
Gotta divide it all right in two

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.503 line:95.75%
Gotta divide it all right in two

00:03:49.326 --> 00:03:53.911 line:95.75%
Gotta divide it all right in two

00:03:54.669 --> 00:04:01.156 line:95.75%
Gotta divide it all right in two

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:49.781 line:95.75%
Fight over the clouds,
over wind, over sky

00:05:49.805 --> 00:05:55.805 line:95.75%
They fight over life,
over blood, over air and light

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:59.893 line:95.75%
Over love, over sun, over another

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:05.505 line:95.75%
They fight, till they die,
over words, polarizing

00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:14.658 line:95.75%
Angels on the sideline again

00:07:15.345 --> 00:07:19.887 line:95.75%
Benched along with patience
and reason

00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:24.730 line:95.75%
Angels on the sideline again

00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:29.819 line:95.75%
Wondering where
this tug of war will end

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:38.345 line:95.75%
Gotta divide it all right in two

00:07:38.627 --> 00:07:43.477 line:95.75%
Gotta divide it all right in two

00:07:44.018 --> 00:07:48.212 line:95.75%
Gotta divide it all right in two

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:52.881 line:95.75%
Right in two

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.068 line:95.75%
Right in two
