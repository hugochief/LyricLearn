I should have known

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:38.518 line:95.75%
I'd leave alone

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.475 line:95.75%
Just goes to show

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:52.317 line:95.75%
That the blood you bleed
is just the blood you owe

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.966 line:95.75%
We were a pair

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:05.885 line:95.75%
But I saw you there

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:12.582 line:95.75%
Too much to bear

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:19.562 line:95.75%
You were my life,
but life is far away from fair

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:23.805 line:95.75%
Was I stupid to love you?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.949 line:95.75%
Was I reckless to help?

00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:33.681 line:95.75%
Was it obvious to everybody else?

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:39.339 line:95.75%
That I'd fallen for a lie

00:01:40.862 --> 00:01:46.902 line:95.75%
You were never on my side

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.900 line:95.75%
Fool me once, fool me twice

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:54.245 line:95.75%
Are you death or paradise?

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:59.226 line:95.75%
Now you'll never see me cry

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.568 line:95.75%
There's just no time to die

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:20.331 line:95.75%
I let it burn

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:26.334 line:95.75%
You're no longer my concern

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:33.399 line:95.75%
Faces from my past return

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:41.016 line:95.75%
Another lesson yet to learn

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:46.141 line:95.75%
That I'd fallen for a lie

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:53.824 line:95.75%
You were never on my side

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.549 line:95.75%
Fool me once, fool me twice

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.954 line:95.75%
Are you death or paradise?

00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:06.032 line:95.75%
Now you'll never see me cry

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:09.789 line:95.75%
There's just no time to die

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.423 line:95.75%
No time to die

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:28.142 line:95.75%
No time to die

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.482 line:95.75%
Fool me once, fool me twice

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.008 line:95.75%
Are you death or paradise?

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.341 line:95.75%
Now you'll never see me cry

00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:50.100 line:95.75%
There's just no time to die
