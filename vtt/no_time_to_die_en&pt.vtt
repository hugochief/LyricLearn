00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.855 line:1
I should have known

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:38.518 line:1
I'd leave alone

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.475 line:1
Just goes to show

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:52.317 line:1
That the blood you bleed
is just the blood you owe

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.966 line:1
We were a pair

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:05.885 line:1
But I saw you there

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:12.582 line:1
Too much to bear

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:19.562 line:1
You were my life,
but life is far away from fair

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:23.805 line:1
Was I stupid to love you?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.949 line:1
Was I reckless to help?

00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:33.681 line:1
Was it obvious to everybody else?

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:39.339 line:1
That I'd fallen for a lie

00:01:40.862 --> 00:01:46.902 line:1
You were never on my side

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.900 line:1
Fool me once, fool me twice

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:54.245 line:1
Are you death or paradise?

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:59.226 line:1
Now you'll never see me cry

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.568 line:1
There's just no time to die

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:20.331 line:1
I let it burn

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:26.334 line:1
You're no longer my concern

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:33.399 line:1
Faces from my past return

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:41.016 line:1
Another lesson yet to learn

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:46.141 line:1
That I'd fallen for a lie

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:53.824 line:1
You were never on my side

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.549 line:1
Fool me once, fool me twice

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.954 line:1
Are you death or paradise?

00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:06.032 line:1
Now you'll never see me cry

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:09.789 line:1
There's just no time to die

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.423 line:1
No time to die

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:28.142 line:1
No time to die

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.482 line:1
Fool me once, fool me twice

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.008 line:1
Are you death or paradise?

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.341 line:1
Now you'll never see me cry

00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:50.100 line:1
There's just no time to die

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.855 line:95.75%
Já devia saber

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:38.518 line:95.75%
Que partiria só

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.475 line:95.75%
Só vem mostrar

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:52.317 line:95.75%
Que o sangue que sangras 
é apenas o sangue que deves

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.966 line:95.75%
Éramos um par

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:05.885 line:95.75%
Mas vi-te lá

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:12.582 line:95.75%
Demasiado para suportar

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:19.562 line:95.75%
Eras a minha vida, 
mas a vida está longe de ser justa

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:23.805 line:95.75%
Fui estúpida por te amar?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.949 line:95.75%
Fui irresponsável por ajudar?

00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:33.681 line:95.75%
Seria óbvio para toda a gente?

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:39.339 line:95.75%
Que caí numa mentira

00:01:40.862 --> 00:01:46.902 line:95.75%
Nunca estiveste do meu lado

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.900 line:95.75%
Enganas-me uma vez, enganas duas

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:54.245 line:95.75%
És a morte ou o paraíso?

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:59.226 line:95.75%
Nunca mais me vês a chorar

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.568 line:95.75%
Não há tempo para morrer

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:20.331 line:95.75%
Deixei arder

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:26.334 line:95.75%
Já não és problema meu

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:33.399 line:95.75%
Voltam rostos do meu passado

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:41.016 line:95.75%
Outra lição para aprender

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:46.141 line:95.75%
Que caí numa mentira

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:53.824 line:95.75%
Nunca estiveste do meu lado

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.549 line:95.75%

Nunca mais me vês a chorar

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:09.789 line:95.75%
Não há tempo para morrer

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.423 line:95.75%
Sem tempo para morrer

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:28.142 line:95.75%
Sem tempo para morrer

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.482 line:95.75%
Enganas-me uma vez, enganas duas

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.008 line:95.75%
