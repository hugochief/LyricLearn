00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.286 line:95.75%
Towing the line

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.107 line:95.75%
I watched the host
drink all the wine

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.642 line:95.75%
And now she rambles

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:48.365 line:95.75%
Through the who
and who have not

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:54.367 line:95.75%
The old man is a painter

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:58.333 line:95.75%
Of tired seascapes 
titled ‘Adventure’

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:04.963 line:95.75%
So my mind wanders
picking at the table to cure the rot

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:09.996 line:95.75%
Like a bird in a world 
with no trees

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:13.861 line:95.75%
You were hung up there
in your disbelief

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:19.588 line:95.75%
I know I'm a hard rock
to drag around

00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:26.073 line:95.75%
Love is in the early mornings

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:29.490 line:95.75%
In the shadows under the trees

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:33.671 line:95.75%
Not in the cuckolded ashes

00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:37.029 line:95.75%
Floating down from the rookery

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:40.681 line:95.75%
Down here,
I’ll crow for you

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:42.948 line:95.75%
You crow for me

00:01:44.993 --> 00:01:48.469 line:95.75%
Down here,
I’ll crow for you

00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:50.815 line:95.75%
You crow for me

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:56.332 line:95.75%
Towing the line

00:01:56.388 --> 00:02:00.377 line:95.75%
I watched the host
drink all the wine

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:06.184 line:95.75%
And now I’m purring
for a drop of anything

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.458 line:95.75%
Throwing stones 
at your window

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.246 line:95.75%
You turn to me 
as if it’s simple

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:20.017 line:95.75%
Why can’t you be 
like the blackbird

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.368 line:95.75%
And sing

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:28.025 line:95.75%
I say I’m 
the westerlies in Ireland

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:31.872 line:95.75%
So decadent and violent

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:34.576 line:95.75%
Can’t you see I’m a forager

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.085 line:95.75%
Clawing at the bedrock

00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:43.975 line:95.75%
Love is in the early mornings

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:47.324 line:95.75%
In the shadows under the trees

00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.664 line:95.75%
Not in the cuckolded ashes

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:54.777 line:95.75%
Floating down from the rookery

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.708 line:95.75%
Down here,
I’ll crow for you

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.809 line:95.75%
You crow for me

00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:06.467 line:95.75%
Down here,
I’ll crow for you

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.537 line:95.75%
You crow for me
