00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:51.250 line:95.75%
Your heart is like a fortress

00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:54.790 line:95.75%
You keep your feelings
locked away

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:58.103 line:95.75%
Is it easier?

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:01.585 line:95.75%
Does it make you feel safe?

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:07.190 line:95.75%
You wander through the darkness

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:10.976 line:95.75%
Of wilderness behind your eyes

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.181 line:95.75%
I know you’re afraid

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:17.629 line:95.75%
But you gotta move on

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.976 line:95.75%
Every fortress falls

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.710 line:95.75%
It is not the end

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:30.611 line:95.75%
It ain't if you fall

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:34.697 line:95.75%
But how you rise that says

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:38.555 line:95.75%
Who you really are

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.451 line:95.75%
So get up and come through

00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:45.188 line:95.75%
If ever your fortress caves

00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:47.329 line:95.75%
You're always safe

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:50.666 line:95.75%
I believe I know you

00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:54.398 line:95.75%
Yet I don't truly know myself

00:01:54.422 --> 00:02:00.393 line:95.75%
I pray you won't feel as alone
as I have felt

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:07.092 line:95.75%
I don't want to fail you so

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.157 line:95.75%
I tell you the awful truth

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:15.056 line:95.75%
Everyone faces darkness
on their own

00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:17.905 line:95.75%
As I have done,
so will you

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:22.154 line:95.75%
Every fortress falls

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:25.973 line:95.75%
It is not the end

00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:29.975 line:95.75%
It ain't if you fall

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.894 line:95.75%
But how you rise that says

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:37.828 line:95.75%
Who you really are

00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:41.710 line:95.75%
So get up and come through

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.291 line:95.75%
If ever your fortress caves

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:48.527 line:95.75%
You're always safe in mine

00:02:54.292 --> 00:03:00.106 line:95.75%
The Earth spins 'round the sun

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.296 line:95.75%
And behold

00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:08.849 line:95.75%
Everything happens

00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:13.862 line:95.75%
Every night falls prey

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:18.966 line:95.75%
To sunrise

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:34.168 line:95.75%
If your fortress is under siege

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.896 line:95.75%
You can always run to me

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.101 line:95.75%
If your fortress is under siege

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:52.577 line:95.75%
You can always run

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.500 line:95.75%
Every fortress falls

00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:02.407 line:95.75%
It is not the end

00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:06.270 line:95.75%
It ain't if you fall

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:10.234 line:95.75%
But how you rise that says

00:04:10.258 --> 00:04:14.178 line:95.75%
Who you really are

00:04:14.202 --> 00:04:18.066 line:95.75%
